The rover drilled into a piece of Martian rock called\r\nCumberland and found some ancient water hidden within it. Researchers were then able to test a key ratio\r\nin the water with Curiosity's onboard instruments...\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Using as a command line tool:\r\n```bash\r\neatiht http://news.yahoo.com/curiosity-rover-drills-mars-rock-finds-water-122321635.html >> out.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: Window's users may have to add the C:\\PythonXX\\Scripts directory to your [\"path\"](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm) so that the command line tool works from any directory, not only the ..\\Scripts directory.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n```\r\nrequests\r\nlxml\r\n```\r\n\r\nMotivation\r\n----------\r\n\r\nAfter searching through the deepest crevices of the internet for some tool|library|module that could effectively extract the main content from a website (ignoring text from ads, sidebar links, etc.), I was slightly disheartened by the apparent ambiguity caused by this content-extraction problem.\r\n\r\nMy survey resulted in some of the following solutions:\r\n\r\n* [boilerpipe](https://code.google.com/p/boilerpipe/) - *Boilerplate Removal and Fulltext Extraction from HTML pages*. Java library written by Christian Kohlsch√ºtter\r\n* [\"The Easy Way to Extract Useful Text from Arbitrary HTML\"](http://ai-depot.com/articles/the-easy-way-to-extract-useful-text-from-arbitrary-html/) - a Python tutorial on implementing a neural network for html content extraction. Written by alexjc\r\n* [Pyteaser's Cleaners module](https://github.com/xiaoxu193/PyTeaser/blob/master/goose/cleaners.py) - from what I can tell, it's a purely heuristic-based process\r\n* [\"Text Extraction from the Web via Text-to-Tag Ratio\"](http://www.cse.nd.edu/~tweninge/pubs/WH_TIR08.pdf) - a thesis on Text-to-Tag-heuristic driven clustering as a solution for the problem at hand. Written by Tim Weninger & William H. Hsu\r\n\r\nThe number of research papers I found on the subject largely outweighs the number available open-source projects. This is my attempt at balancing out the disparity.\r\n\r\nIn the process of coming up with a solution, I made two unoriginal observations:\r\n\r\n1. XPath's select all (//), parent node (..) queries and functions ('string-length') are remarkably powerful when used together\r\n2. Unnecessary machine learning is unnecessary\r\n\r\nBy making an assumption on sentence length, and this is trivial, one can query for text-nodes satisfying said sentence length, then create a frequency distribution (histogram) across the parent-nodes, and the argmax of the resulting distribution is the xpath that is shared amongst likely sentences.\r\n\r\nThe results were surprisingly good. I personally prefer this approach to the others as it seems to lie somewhere in between the purely rule-based and the drowning-in-ML approaches.\r\n\r\nIssues or Contact\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nPlease raise any [issues](https://github.com/rodricios/eatiht/issues) or yell at me at rodrigopala91@gmail.com or [@rodricios](https://twitter.com/rodricios)\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n-----\r\n\r\n* ~~Add newline and tab options for printing.~~ Please check out the [demo](http://web-tier-load-balancer-1502628209.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com/filter?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/world/asia/us-links-north-korea-to-sony-hacking.html) for the new **default** output (sorry, no options for formatting as of yet).\r\n","google":"UA-57938819-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
